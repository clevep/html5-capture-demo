# html5-capture-demo

A very simple demo which uses HTML5 and JS to activate the camera, allows you to
capture a frame, and then store it.

Capturing is done using the [getUserMedia
API](http://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/getusermedia.html) and we use
a canvas tag as an intermediary to download a frame.
